# K-Nearest-Neighbour model of Percept-generated data

Builds, tests, runs and exports a model of human perception data for street view images based on feature encodings from CLIP and the K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm.

Please see the [Percept](https://github.com/Spatial-Data-Science-and-GEO-AI-Lab/percept-backend) project for the mobile web survey app to gather and generate the raw data.

## Huggingface demos:
* [Percept Map Explorer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Spatial-Data-Science-and-GEO-AI-Lab/percept-map): end-to-end demo, click on a map and get modelled perception scores for that point.
* [Percept Image Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Spatial-Data-Science-and-GEO-AI-Lab/percept-image): generates modelled perception scores for a given image.
* [Amsterdam KNN Model](https://huggingface.co/Spatial-Data-Science-and-GEO-AI-Lab/svi_percept): a model generated by this code and the data from the Amsterdam case study.
